# Laundry Image Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop predictive models to determine the optimal washing and drying methods for different clothing items. We employ two distinct approaches: a baseline conventional machine learning model and an advanced model. These models tackle a classification problem, predicting the best cleaning methods based on images of the clothing items. By evaluating their performance using relevant metrics, we aim to identify which model produces the most accurate results. Ultimately, these models can be leveraged by retailers and individuals to simplify decisions regarding appropriate clothing care methods.
